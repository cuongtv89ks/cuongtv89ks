> By relieving the brain of all unnecessary work, a good notation sets it free to concentrate on more advanced problems, and in effect increases the mental power of the race.[...T]he  technical terms of any profession or trade are incomprehensible  to  those  who  have  never  been  trained to use them. But this is not because they are difficult in themselves. On the contrary they have invariably been introduced to make things easy.

First of all, I created this site for my hobbits that simply writing whatever I want. At the beginning, I thought that just google blog or wordpress is enough. However there is unlimited imagine that I want (or I don't know how to set up template and theme, but if you can setup it, it looks like you have to deeply know about html, css ...). Then how about a private site, that is good idea to start with great land. This land I can learn html, css, javascrip for programing website (It is gradually important to me). For now, I am learning Linux Platform, and C program first. Also I can write about photography, guitar, Korean life, my recording for audiobook that I wanted to do for 3 months ago. 


I decided using English for main posts (this also helps me improve my English) and Korean for my Korean life. I do not know how far I can go, but at least I arrived here to start my blog by clear way. (I also have google blog, but just private blog)


Fortunately, one of my friend recommended to me using [github](www.github.com). It seems opening a new horizon.
