First of all, I created this site for my hobbits that simply writing whatever I want. At the beginning, I thought that just google blog or wordpress is enough. However there is unlimited imagine that I want (or I don't know how to set up template and theme, but if you can setup it, it looks like you have to deeply know about html, css ...). Then how about a private site, that is good idea to start with great land. This land I can learn html, css, javascrip for programing website (It is gradually important to me). For now, I am learning Linux Platform. Also I can write about photography, guitar, Korean life, ...

Fortunately, one of my friend recommended to me using [github](www.github.com). It seems opening a new horizon that I can explore.
