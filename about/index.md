My name is Cuong Tran Viet  and I was born in 1989. I graduated  Electronics and Telecommunications [FET](http://e.uet.vnu.edu.vn/taxonomy/term/5/27) at VNU University of Engineering and Technology. I love Electronics, technology, photography and guitar. Always open to new, incredulous, curious and too often against the trend (the classical sheep that doesnâ€™t want to follow the herd).


* 2007 I enrolled in the Electronics and Telecommunications at Vietnam National University.
* 2011 My graduation thesis "Building system measure and control using Power Line Communication technology, standard Lonworks" ([Video](https://youtu.be/JJyp_-AzI58)) under supervisions Dr. Nguyen Thang Long.
* 2011 - 2014 I worked in [Hanel Professional Electronics JSC](http://www.hpe.vn/?ui=desktop)
* 2014 I got KGSP schlarship ([Korean Gorvernment Scholarship Program](http://www.niied.go.kr/eng/contents.do?contentsNo=78&menuNo=349)) for higher education. Now I am studying for master.
